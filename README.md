# poolgp.distribute
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/poolgp.distribute.svg)](https://clojars.org/poolgp.distribute)

A Clojure library for using a genetic programming system with the poolgp distributed evaluation system.

## Usage

Include this library in the dependencies for your project.

In your ns declaration: `(:require [poolgp.distribute :as poolgp])`

(Note: this should be in `clojush.src.pushgp.pushgp/compute-errors`)

```clojure

;wait for eval containers to start
(Thread/sleep 10000)

;start distribution worker, opp pool worker, and return worker (if not started)
(poolgp/start-dist-services {
  :incoming-port 8000
  :outgoing-port 9999
  :opp-pool-req-p 8888
  :host "eval"})

;register population as opponents
(poolgp/register-opponents (map deref pop-agents))

;send opponents to distribution worker
(dorun (map #((if use-single-thread swap! send)
             %1 evaluate-individual poolgp/eval-indiv %2 argmap)
           pop-agents
           rand-gens))

;wait for evaluation to complete
(when-not use-single-thread (apply await pop-agents)) ;; SYNCHRONIZE

;merge individual's fitness as opponent with individual's regular fitness
(let [opps (map deref pop-agents)]
 (dorun (map #((if use-single-thread swap! send)
               %1 poolgp/merge-opp-performance opps)
             pop-agents)))
```
